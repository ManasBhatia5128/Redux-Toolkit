Flux: designed by facebook
Redux: never mutate your state: that;s why redux toolkit introduced

Redux-toolkit mein ek hi store hota hai: single source of truth
configureStore: reducer: saare to
Redux toolki is battry included library ie redux mein context api se bhi zyada setup/ configuration krni padti thi however redux toolkit is battry included ie pehle se hi kaafi configurations hui hoti hain

initialState: default predefined state
state: updated (prev) state value of the store
action: action.payload ie input milta hai
nanoid: library used for generating unique ids

redux mein state ka direct access hai that's why hum directly value thorugh .push() function put kr paate hain unlike context API jisme hume spread operator ka kaafi use krna padta hai

value bhejne ke liye dispatch: eg courier dispatch, we do it during add
select: select krne ke liye selector, access callback mein milta hai

useSelector: value select krni hai
useDispatch: value dispatch krnhi hai

Redux: javascript library
React mein bhi redux use krte hain that's why 2 instatllations
